# GL
Game Language (DSL for automata game)

###Quick Guide to GL

The GL is a specialized (DSL) simple but flexible programming language design for the needs of a game. It is easy and does not require previous experience in a programming language.

It has been designed with the ability to offer readable syntax, separating each basic functionality with distinctive symbols.

The variables to take effect with the dollar sign ($), the tables with the symbol for (@) and the grouping using symbol (#) are few examples.

There is no distinction between capital and small letters.

It is a modern language, each stage of a program run by the GL in series.

It has borrowed elements from different programming languages ​​and has adapted lawsuits ideas for easy syntax automation.

It has features that one can find in other languages but ​​are heaping on the needs of the game.

Each element of the language should be separated by a comma (,) and the end of the program mark with a dot (.) After the dot everything else is ignored.

For the use of the game has a number of built-in procedures (Build In Functions) which is necessary to navigate the main object of the game and make it much easier to develop the program.

The following tables have what it takes to play the game by writing simple programs in GL. Apart from the following description of the elements of the language you can find a number of useful examples here.


Have fun!
